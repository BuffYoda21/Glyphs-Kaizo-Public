# Glyphs Kaizo

This is where you can download the Glyphs Kaizo mod. Right now it only buffs the spearman but *much* more content is planned. As of now it is only compatable with Glyphs version 1.6 but when 1.7 launches I will make an effort to update this mod alongside it. This mod may also run on Glyphs version 1.5 but this is untested and not recomended.

# Installation Instructions
1) Download MelonLoader at https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/tag/v0.7.0 I recommend using the cooresponding MelonLoader.Installer for your OS over the other options because it makes your life easier.
2) Run the installer, click "Add Game Manually", then navigate to your Glyphs executable.
3) MelonLoader will create a bunch of additonal files and folders in your Glyphs folder and once it is done, drag and drop your GlyphsKaizo.dll into the Mods folder (make sure you download the correct version of the mod for your game version!).
4) Run the game. You should see the MelonLoader log pop up and show the mod being loaded.
