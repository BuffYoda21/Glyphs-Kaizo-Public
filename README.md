# Glyphs Kaizo

This is where you can download the Glyphs Kaizo mod. Right now it only buffs the spearman but *much* more content is planned. When installing make sure you use the correct release for your game version (GlyphsKaizo v0.4.1-Spear for any version of Glyphs prior to v1.7.0  and whatever the latest release is for Glyphs v1.7.0 and onwards). This mod may also run on Glyphs version 1.5 but this is untested and not recomended.

# Installation Instructions
1) Download MelonLoader [here](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/tag/v0.7.0). I recommend using the cooresponding MelonLoader.Installer for your OS over the other options because it makes your life easier.
2) Run the installer, click "Add Game Manually", then navigate to your Glyphs executable.
3) MelonLoader will create a bunch of additonal files and folders in your Glyphs folder and once it is done, drag and drop your GlyphsKaizo.dll into the Mods folder (Get this from the releases page [here](https://github.com/BuffYoda21/Glyphs-Kaizo-Public/releases)).
4) Run the game. You should see the MelonLoader log pop up and show the mod being loaded.
